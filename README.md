# Library Simulation

## Makefile

Use the Makefile to compile, run and clean using the following commands:

```bash
$ make 
$ make run
$ make clean
```

Note that, `make run`, does the following thing:

```bash
$ ./libsim 100 20 10 2
```

If you want to enter your own argument values, run the executable manually, by giving in terminal the following:

```bash
$ ./libsim <N_Max> <L> <K1> <K2>
```
